## Home_Sales


In this repository you'll find the **Home_Sales.ipynb** file where all the code required by the challenge is held. 

In this analysis we extracted the average cost of houses for year of sales and for year of construction, we cached the dataframe and uncached the dataframe at the end of the analysis and also we performed an analysis of the time of response of the same query before and after partitioning the data frame with parquet.

All the code that you'll find in this repository was done by me with the help of the class materials.
